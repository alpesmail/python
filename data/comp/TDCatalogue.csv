01: Systems Engineering Support::Disciplines related to the interdisciplinary approach governing the total technical and managerial effort required to transform a set of customer needs, expectations, and constraints into a solution and to support that solution throughout its life. Also includes system-/ platform-level testing, configuration management
010: System Engineering PMT (Systems Engineering Processes, Methods and Tools)::Defining and enforcing the use of engineering processes, methodologies and tools in order to enhance quality and efficiency of programme and project performance. This includes the definition of innovative engineering processes, methods & tools, including Requirements Mgt Tools and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), and also process assurance, product lifecycle management.
011: Operational Analysis::Activities which enable to capture, anticipate and define customer needs, to develop respective scenarios and derive operational concepts with systems demands in response to these needs. This covers analysis of the operational scenario in a system of system context including requirements and functional analysis based on Concept of Operations (ConOps) and Concepts of Use (ConUse)
012: System Model, Sim & Virtualization (System Modelling, Simulation & Virtualization)::Elaboration of models of system behaviour, design and development of constructive simulations of systems and SoS solutions
013: Concept. Des Incl Pre-sizing & Arch (Conceptual Design Including Pre-sizing & Architecture)::Design of innovative and path breaking concepts to improve current solution portfolio. Identification of new products, Systems or solutions with respect to efficient and mission goal oriented ConUse (Concepts of Use). It also includes the conceptual design, early dimensioning or pre-sizing and first architecture.
014: Configuration Management::Definition of Engineering Procedures to guarantee a unique identification, controlled storage, change control, and status reporting of selected intermediate work products, product components, and products during the life of a system.
02: Safety, Envir., Airworth., Human Fac (Safety, Environment, Airworthiness, Human Factors)::Transversal disciplines that cover an entire product/ system and are required for a great number of products, including for example:- Safety engineering and safety management throughout the life cycle of a product- Environmental effects and their potential impact on a system and humans and other organisms in this context- Human factors, like cognitive processes, capabilities and limitations of humans, as well as human machine interface principles
020: Safety:: Study condition of being protected against consequences of failure, damage, error, accidents, harm or any other event which could be considered non-desirable. This supposes to impact the maintenance and the maintainability Study methods and tools to determine and to identify the origins, the events, and the consequences of an accident so as prevent further incidents of a similar kind.
021: Environmental Qualification::Test to be modified ( not done ) : Definition, validation and verification of related design requirements for any product in the supporting systems (e.g. AGE, ILS systems, ESS etc., Trainers) and enabling systems (e.g. Test Rigs, repair facilities ). These requirements can range from combined temperature/altitude/humidity conditions to vibration or electromagnetic effects (and many others) and should ensure compatibility of the operating system with the relevant environmental conditions.
022: Human Factors & Ergonomics::Design, validation and verification of advanced HMI concepts and technologies. Study human-specific physical, cognitive, or social properties which either may interact in a critical or dangerous manner with technological systems, human natural environment, or human organizations, or they can be taken under consideration in the design of ergonomic human-user oriented equipments.
023: Airworthiness & Certification::Study field devoted to interpret regulations and requirements and work on proposals of rules changes. Study field devoted to optimise certification processes. Study field of operational matters and certification: design of Flight Procedures, application of Human Factors , Pilot Training and analysis of Accident Reports.
03: In-service Support Engineering::Disciplines applied in engineering to ensure the support of a product while in service, e.g., but not limited to, RAMT, documentation development and structural integrity
030: Useability / Operability / RAMT::Set of processes for operability, usability, supportability, reliability & availability, maintainability, testability & scheduled maintenance.
031: Product Data for Operation & Maint. (Product Data for Operation & Maintenance)::Includes the transformation of international standards, norms into Tech Pubs IT Systems, the creation of Air Crew publication, maintenance planning publication, data modules for maintenance publication and trouble shooting, Wiring diagram, technical illustrations for Tech Pubs.
032: Technical Logistics::Development of engineering support systems for any type of customer based on customer requirements.
033: Structural Integrity & Health Mgt. (Structural Integrity & Health Management)::Disciplines applied in engineering to ensure structural integrity of a product while in service (structural health monitoring process, damage assessment, structural integrity analysis)
04: Materials::Metallic and composite/non-metallic material properties as well as related manufacturing, repair and treatment technologies and processes
